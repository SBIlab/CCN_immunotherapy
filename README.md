# CCN_immunotherapy
## Description
This is source code for constructing cell-cell communication networks using patient's bulk tumor transcriptome and prediction of patient response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) using the patient's cell-cell communication network (CCN)

## Requirements
1. construction of CCN
- R (v 4.0.2)
- 

2. response prediction using CCN

## Usage
1. Construction of cell-cell communication networks
input: cell type-specific gene expression profiles

2. Response prediction using CCN
input: communication strength between cells
