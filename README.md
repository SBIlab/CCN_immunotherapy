# Prediction of patient response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) using the patient's cell-cell communication network (CCN)

1. Construction of cell-cell communication networks
input: cell type-specific gene expression profiles

2. Response prediction using CCN
input: communication strength between cells
